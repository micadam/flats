# Flats

A simple tool in Python for periodically searching for flats (UK-centric).

Currently queries Zoopla and Rightmove, might add more services later. Periodically pulls the first page of latest flats and rings the terminal bell when it finds flats it hasn't seen during the current execution.

## Usage
```
$python_cmd -m flats
```
